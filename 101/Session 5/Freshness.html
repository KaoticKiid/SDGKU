    <h1>Keep it Fresh!</h1>
    <p class="square">• Keep it Fresh Buy your toilet paper at Costco, not your coffee. If your coffee is not fresh, the notes fade and so will its potential in your cup. Buy coffee that is roasted-to-order. Look for the roast date as proof on the bag.

        <br> <br> Really great ceramic coffee container.

        <br> <br> Air, heat, light and moisture are coffee’s enemy. You see oxygen is the biggest antagonist to our little bean friends and quite the bully. So with that, fresh roasted coffee is the only way to go - unless a gamma ray burst from a distant
        star blasts away our oxygen rich atmosphere - well we wouldn’t be here anyway, so this is a moot point. Therefore, coffee beans should be stored properly in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. I prefer a ceramic container with a rubber
        gasket on the lid for a tight seal.Singing coffee beans.
        <br> <br> Coffee reaches its joyful peak 3-10 days after it is roasted.Sadly, it degrades quickly after two weeks, losing its voice, its song, thus its vanquished into an abyss, into a proverbial Coffee Black Hole after a month. Yes, this roasted
        bean’s short life is over - like that of the Hu-hu-ma-tu-tu. But don’t be sad. Just order some more and the notes will sing and dance across your palette once again!
        <br> <br> Freezing your beans -- A chilly proposition. Though hotly debated amongst the coffee elite, some experts believe, if done properly, you can indeed extend the life and freshness of your beans for up to a month by freezing them. (See the
        chilling details below.)

        <br> <br> Baratza burr coffee grinder.

        <br> <br> • Only grind your beans right before use Once coffee is ground, it degrades rapidly! Purchase a Burr Grinder and grind beans only as needed. No dilly-dallying here, grind and brew for results that are truest to the bean itself.
