    <p class="square">Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain
        Coffea species. The genus Coffea is native to tropical Africa (specifically having its origin in Ethiopia and
        Sudan) and Madagascar, the Comoros, Mauritius,
        and Réunion in the Indian Ocean.[2] Coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the
        equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, Indian subcontinent, and Africa. The two most commonly grown
        are C. arabica and C.
        robusta. Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds (referred to as "beans")
        are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with
        near-boiling water
        to produce the beverage known as coffee.</class>

        <blockquote> Is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to
            its caffeine content.[3] It is one of the most popular drinks in the world,[4] and it can be prepared and
            presented in a variety of ways (e.g.,
            espresso, French press, caffè latte). It is usually served hot, although iced coffee is a popular
            alternative. Clinical studies indicate that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial in
            healthy adults, with continuing research
            on whether long-term consumption lowers the risk of some diseases, although those long-term studies are of
            generally poor quality.[5]</blockquote>

    <p class="square"><q>While coffee is native to Ethiopia and Sudan, the earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking
            as the modern beverage appears in modern-day Yemen in southern Arabia in the middle of the 15th century in
            Sufi shrines.[6] It was in what is now Yemen that coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner
            similar to how it is now prepared for drinking. But the coffee seeds had to be first exported from East
            Africa to Yemen, as Coffea arabica is thought to have been indigenous to the former.[7] The Yemenis obtained
            their coffee via Somali traders from Berbera (who in turn procured the beans from the Ethiopian Highlands)
            and began to cultivate the seed. By the 16th century, the drink had reached Persia, Turkey, and North
            Africa. From there, it spread to Europe and the rest of the world.</q></p>
